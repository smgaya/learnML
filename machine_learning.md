## Introduction

Generally learning means aquisition of knowledge or skill either from study or experience. This knowledge aquired can be be applied and become meaningfull and valued.

Machine Learning is branch of computer science, specific in Artifical intelligence which provide computer systems ability to learn from data and improve their experience without being more progamed.

There is two main type of machine learning, one is **Supervised machine learning** and another is **Unsupervised machine learning** the main different from the two is supervised is it uses the algorithms that is limited to learning and decide in a ceratin way while in unsupervised the algorithms used they decide themselvies for the data to output.

## Supervised Learning.

Supervised learning problem can be devide in the following ways:

- Classfication
- Regression

## Unsupervised Learning.

Unsupervised learning problem can be categorised in the following :

- Clustering
- Assocoation

## Machine learning Algorithm.

The following is list of machine learing algorithm:

- Linear Regression
- Logistic Regresssion( LOGIT)
- Decision Tree
-  Support Vector Machine
-  Naive Bayes
-  K-Nearest neighbours
-  K-Mean clustering
-  Random Forest
-  adaboost
