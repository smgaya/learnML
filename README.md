##Introduction
Since invertion of computer, human have worked so hard to increase the computer ability to work in efficiency and effective means of helping human and for long time computer have desined to help automate most repitative work in different field with higher accuracy. From time to time the growth of computer intelligence have been significant. The basic idea is to create machine intellinage that will meet the intelligence of human.

What is Artifical Intelligence( AI)

**Artifical intelligence** *is the branch of computer science that deals with way to make computer controlled-robot or software think intelligently mimic the human intelligence.* 

This is done by studing how human brain works and how human learn and use same methods to computer. The following have been major interest in AI as it is also challencing
 
 *	How AI can leanrn from data ?
 * Can AI teach itself ?
 * Can AI respond in time ?
 * Can AI think and make decision that will safe human ?
 * Can AI archive accuracy ?
 * can AI organize/categorize and make better understand out of it ?
 
 
 What is intelligence ?
 
 **Intelligence** *is the ability of the system to calculate, reason, perceive relationship and analogy, learn from experience, stored and retrived imformation from memory and use it to solve problems, comprehend complex ideas, use of natural language, classify,generalize and adopt new situation.*

Type of intelligence 

* Lingustic Intelligence -Narration
* Musical Intelligence -Musicians
* Logic-Mathematic Intelligenace -Mathematics
* Spatial Intelligence -Austonatus/physician
* Bodyly-Kinesthetic Intelligence -player/dancer
* Intra-personal Intelligence -buddha
* Interpersonal intelligence. -mass communication-politician

The machine can be considered with AI when comprise one of the above intelligence. The above can be categorised into the following intangible abilities:

* Reasoning
* Learning
* Perception
* Problem Solving 
* Lingustic Intelligence

AI have many study areas in which in combination can provide intelligence, here are some of the studied area:

* [Machine Learing](machine_learning)
* Logic
* Searching
* Artifical Neural Networks
* Genetic Algorithim
* Knowledge Representation

For this case AI has been very sucussessfull and has been applied in different areas as it is developed such as_

* Gaming
* Natural Language processing
* Expert system
* Computer vision
* Speach Recognition
* Handwritting Recognition
* Robotics
* cognitive modeling
